# Monitoring-Apache-Airflow-Workflows-with-Prometheus
The project is centered around a Docker-based infrastructure, leveraging various data sources such as articles and websites to build a robust reference. The primary objective is to implement an efficient monitoring solution for Airflow metrics using Prometheus and finally creating a dashboard in Grafana to show case the metrics..
